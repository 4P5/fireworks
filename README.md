# fireworks
Randomly generates a spawner with a configurable number of random fireworks, each with a number of random stars, colours, explosions, etc.

Outputs a file to `output.txt`, which can be pasted into a command block. Careful with large numbers, as you can easily exceed Minecraft's limit and chunk-ban yourself.
